# Analog Control of an Inverted Pendulum
This was a project required by my Applied Mechatronics course at Auburn University.  In this project, we were meant to calculate and implement Full State Feedback
on an inverted pendulum to meet certain performance requirements.  The requirements were a damping coefficient of 0.707 and a settling time of 0.5s.  The controls to
meet these specifications were implemented via op-amp gains utilizing the LF412 op-amp.
